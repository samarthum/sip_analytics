## Project Motivation

My mother owns a franchise of SIP Abacus. I wanted to look at some of the data that the centres are made to record in order to gain some insights that the business might not have previously discovered. Mainly, I wanted to understand:
- What is the rate of student dropout?
- Is there a trend to this dropout?
- Where is the centre headed in terms of growth?

## Blog Post

The main findings of this analysis can be found on my website [here](https://samarthmamadapur.com/2022/01/14/analysing-the-health-of-an-abacus-centre/).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank SIP Sanjaynagar, Bangalore for giving me access to their data, and allowing me to scrutinise the workings of the business.
